## Who can contribute

Everyone is welcome.

<br/>

## How to contribute

*If you don't know how to contribute to a project, read the [GitHub Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) first.*

<br/>

If you want to contribute to LogDoctor, please follow these steps:

  - Possibly open an **Issue** before to start, to declare what your contribution will be

  - **Fork** the `devel` branch of this project

  - **Improve** it with your ideas

  - Submit a **Pull Request** to the same branch (`devel`)

<br/>

## Why the DEVEL branch

It's related to the git system and mantainer's choice.<br/>
The `main` branch contains website-specific contents, which differ from site to site, while the `devel` branch is (supposed) to be the same and to act as an indipendent base for the code (and hopefully to keep a linear history).<br/>
As an example, if you push changes to the `main` branch on github, they won't appear as yours on gitlab (or whatever other site this repo is or will be hosted on) because the `devel` branch will never pull changes happened to `main`, so if you want your contribution to be part of the git repository indipendently from the platform, please follow the instructions.

<br/>

## Pull Requests

When submitting a PR, please leave a message with it explaining which has been your changes.
