## How to fork the DEVEL branch

You have two ways of doing it:

  - while forking:
    - **uncheck** the "*Only copy the main branch*" option

  *or*
     
  - alternatively, you can do it afterwards:
    - step in your copy of the repository
    - select `branches` or click on `main` and select "*View all branches*"
    - tap `New branch`
    - insert the name you please and select `elB4RTO/devel` as branch source

<br/>

## Why the DEVEL branch

It's related to the git system and mantainer's choice.<br/>
The `main` branch contains website-specific contents, which differ from site to site, while the `devel` branch is (supposed) to be the same and to act as an indipendent base for the code (and hopefully to keep a linear history).<br/>
As an example, if you push changes to the `main` branch on github, they won't appear as yours on gitlab (or whatever other site this repo is or will be hosted on) because the `devel` branch will **never** pull changes happened to `main`, meaning that changes will have to be copy-pasted to the `devel` branch and re-committed.
