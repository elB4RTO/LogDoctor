  - Download a pre-compiled [Release](https://github.com/elB4RTO/LogDoctor/releases)
  - Run the installation executable, or the installation script if you prefer it<br/><br/>

<br/>

### How to compile

- Install the *dependencies* you're missing (usually the list reduces to just *Qt*, and *cmake* at least).<br/><br/>
- Download and unzip this repo
  <br/>*or*<br/>
  `git clone https://github.com/elB4RTO/LogDoctor`<br/><br/>
- Open a terminal inside "*LogDoctor-main/*"
  <br/>*or*<br/>
  `cd LogDoctor/`<br/><br/>
- Prepare a build folder:
  <br/>`mkdir build && cd build`<br/><br/>
- Prepare **Cmake**'s build files:
  <br/>`cmake ../logdoctor -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel`<br/><br/>
- Use **Cmake** to compile the entire project:
  <br/>`cmake --build ./ --target all`<br/><br/>
  If compilation fails, use the following command before to rebuild:
  <br/>`cmake --build ./ --target clean`
  <br/><br/>
- Once done, you can move the executable file wherever you want and execute it from there.<br/>

<br/><br/>

## Updates

### Version check

A version check utility is available while running LogDoctor to check the availability of a new version.<br/>
To check for updates, open the menu `Utilities`â†’`Version check`.

<br/>

    - Mac OS: `chmod +x ./build_update_MAC.sh && ./build_update_MAC.sh`<br/><br/>
- **From binary**
  - Download a pre-compiled [Release](https://github.com/elB4RTO/LogDoctor/releases)<br/>
  - Run the update script

<br/><br/><br/>

## Before to start

When you run LogDoctor for the first time, please take a minute to set-up the things it needs.<br/>
Head to the **configurations** section and give a look at least at the [logs format](#logs-format) settings. You have to tell the doctor what he'll be dealing with!

<br/><br/>

## Logs data

Archived (**gzipped**) log files can be used as well as normal files.

<br/>

### Storage

Parsed data will be stored in an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/about.html) database, which makes it easy to transport/view/edit it as you please.<br/>
If LogDoctor's funcionalities aren't enough for your needs, you can always use a *DB manager* or the SQLite *API* to make your own queries and retrieve the data you need.

<br/>

### Examined fields

Not all the available log fields (expecially for *Apache2* and *Nginx*) are taken into consideration.<br/>
The considered fields are:
- **Date** and **Time**
- Request stuff: **Protocol**, **Method**, **URI** and **Query**
- Server stuff: **Bytes received**, **Bytes sent** and **Time taken**
- Client stuff: **User-agent**, **IP address**, **Cookie** and **Referrer site**

Further informations can be found in the [wiki !!!LINK!!!]() or while running LogDoctor.

<br/>

### Logs options

Various options can be configured about log files.

<br/>

#### Usage control

When you parse a file, it will be hashed using the **SHA256** algorithm and the hash will be stored in another database, to keep track of which files you've already used and help you not parsing them twice.<br/>

##### Note

For the ones who don't know, *SHA256* produces an irreversible hash, which means that no information about the file can be retrieved from the hash.<br/>
You have full control on the hashes database (same as for the logs-data database): you can move, delete, view or edit it the way you want (but you must keep the original file-name).<br/>
LogDoctor will **never** grab and/or use any information about you or the usage you make of it. Feel free.

<br/>

#### Logs path

A different logs path can be used for any of the three supported *Web Servers*.<br/>
It can be the default system folder or any folder you decide to use, just set it in the options.

<br/>

#### Logs format

Before to start parsing logs, you must set-up the *log format* that LogDoctor will have to use.<br/>
Head to the **configurations** section, tap `Logs`, select the **Web Server** you want to configure and tap `Format`.<br/>
Once inside the **Format** section, yo can insert the *log format string* you're using. Don't forget to use the `Generete preview` button to generate a *log line sample* and **check the correctness** of the format!<br/>

For reliability reasons, LogDoctor **does not** support the usage of the **Carriage Return** inside the log format string.

<br/>

##### Apache2

The log format string must be specified. Any format is supported, if valid.<br/>
To retrieve your format string:
- open the configuration file `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`
- *usually*, the line you're looking for is the one starting with `LogFormat` and ending with `combined`. It should be somewhere near to the end of the file.
- you must not paste the whole line, just the part holding the *format string*.<br/>
  Example:<br/>
  - this is the whole line:<br/>
    ```
    LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"" combined
    ```
  - this is the *format string*:<br/>
    ```
    %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"
    ```
    please notice that you have to remove the enclosing quotes/apostrophes as well<br/>

More informations can be found in the [wiki !!!LINK!!!]() or while setting the format.

<br/>

##### Nginx

The log format string must be specified. Any format is supported, if valid.<br/>
To retrieve your format string:<br/>
- open the configuration file `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
- *usually*, the line you're looking for is the one starting with `log_format main`. It should be somwehere in the middle of the file
- one **important** thing: don't paste the indentations and new lines! The default line is usualy declared in consecutive lines, and indented. You must reduce it to a one consecutive string (by also removing the *apostrophes* in the middle of it). The best way is to do this job inside the configuration file, then save and restart Nginx to see if any error is thrown.<br/>
  Example:
  - this is the whole line:<br/>
    ```
    log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                    '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                    '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" "$gzip_ratio"';
    ```
  - this is the resulting *format string*:<br/>
    ```
    $remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" $status $bytes_sent "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" "$gzip_ratio"
    ```
    please notice that you have to remove the enclosing apostrophes/quotes as well<br/>

More informations can be found in the [wiki !!!LINK!!!]() or while setting the format.

<br/>

##### IIS

Supported log formats are: **W3C**, **NCSA** and **IIS**.<br/>

The *NCSA* and *IIS* modules doesn't allow any modification from the user, so nothing more have to be specified.

The *W3C* module instead allows the user to decide which fields to log, and thus you must declare the *log format string* you're using.
To retrieve your format string (for the *W3C* module only):
- open any of the log files which have been generated by this module
- the line you're looking for is the one starting with `#Fields:`, usually at the beginning of the file.<br/>
  Example:<br/>
  - this is the whole line:<br/>
    ```
    #Fields: date time s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) cs(Referer) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken
    ```
  - this is the *format string*:<br/>
    ```
    date time s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) cs(Referer) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken
    ```

More informations can be found in the [wiki !!!LINK!!!]() or while setting the format.

<br/><br/>

#### Blacklist

You can add elements to the **blacklist** to avoid storing the lines containing those elements.

Each web server has its own list.

<br/>

#### Warnlist

As for the *blacklist*, you can add elements to the **warnlist**.<br/>
*Warnlists* will mark with a **warning** the lines triggering them. Warnings can be viewed and modified in the relative [statistics](#warnings) section.

Each web server has its own lists.

<br/>

## Statistics

Most of the *statistics sections* allows you to set filters to the log fields, to skim data by only including lines matching those parameters.<br/>

<br/>

### Warnings

In the *warning* section you can view the lines which triggered a warning, as well as remove any of the warnings and/or add your own.<br/>

<br/>

### Speed

In the *speed* section you can view how fast has been your server at serving contents (if you logged the *time taken*, of course).<br/>

![screenshot](https://github.com/elB4RTO/CRAPLOG/blob/main/crapshots/LogDoctor/stats_speed.png)

<br/>

### Counts

The *count* section is very simple. It just shows the recurrence of the elements for a specific field.<br/>

![screenshot](https://github.com/elB4RTO/CRAPLOG/blob/main/crapshots/LogDoctor/stats_counts.png)

<br/>

### Time of day

In the *time of day* section you can see the traffic, in terms of number of requests logged.<br/>
When viewing a period of time, the mean value (of all the logged days in that period) is shown.<br/>

![screenshot](https://github.com/elB4RTO/CRAPLOG/blob/main/crapshots/LogDoctor/stats_daytime.png)

<br/>

### Relational

In the *relational* section you can view how many times a specific field brought to another.<br/>
This section is more suited for long periods of time.<br/>

![screenshot](https://github.com/elB4RTO/CRAPLOG/blob/main/crapshots/LogDoctor/stats_relational.png)

<br/>

### Globals

In the *globals* section you can have an overview of your logs history.<br/>

![screenshot](https://github.com/elB4RTO/CRAPLOG/blob/main/crapshots/LogDoctor/stats_globals.png)

<br/><br/>

## Extra features

### Log files viewer

Use the built-in logs viewer to inspect the content of your log files.<br/>
Color schemes will be applied using the currently set log format.

<br/>

### Block-note

A block-note utility is available at `Tools`â†’`BlockNote` which can be used to temporary write text, notes, etc.

<br/>

### Games

Simple mini-games to pass the time.

COMING SOON.

<br/><br/>

## Final considerations

### Backups

LogDoctor can automatically do a backup of your **logs database** file, so you can recover your data in case something goes wrong.<br/>

Move inside LogDoctor's folder (if you don't know/remember the path, open the `Utilities`â†’`Infos`>`Paths` menu to view it) and open the folder named "**backups**'.<br/>
Here you will find the backups with an increasing index, where '.1' represents the newest.

A new backup is made every time you quit LogDoctor after doing a job which affected the database in any way.

#### Note

Only the *logs-data database* will be backed-up, the *hashes database* **won't**.<br/>
This is because it is unlikely (supposedly impossible) that a hash equals another, therefore they're supposed to be useful for a short period of time (that is, since you or your web server delete the original log files).

<br/>

### Estimated working speed

1~15 MB/s

May be higher or lower depending on the complexity of the logs, the complexity of the blacklist/warnlists, your hardware and the workload of your system during the execution.
